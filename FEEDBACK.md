# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look good! Feel free to use this space a playground to go beyond the required deliverables and get additional feedback. 

# Part Two - More to OO
- Make sure you're testing in a console.rb file! The issues listed below you could've caught and fixed if you tested your code. 
- Missing `Doctor.all` method. This will break your `find_by_speciality` method.
- Multiple syntax errors in `patient.rb`. If your code breaks, even if there is a lot that is correct there, it will count against you in assessments. You need to write tested, working code. If you're not sure how to test, please reach out or consult the lecture videos. You also have a typo in your initialize `@age = specialty`  and decrease impatience instead of increasing it in your `inquire_appt_ready` method and aren't using your private method inside of that method. 

# Part Four - Associations
Part 4 not completed yet; will revisit after part 4 has been pushed. Part 3 methods should be commented out.
